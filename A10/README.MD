# This folder contains the solution for the Greedy Gift Givers Problem
## Approach:
You are basically trying to figure out whether if an indivdual will have a profit or loss (net income) after they have recieved and given money for gifts.
The names of the individuals would be read into a vector "v". Then, the first indivdual in the group would receive an amount to spend and the amount of friends 
he has. Separate equally the amounts between each friend. There will come a time for the person who is giving to receive money. the amount received wil then be subtracted from the amnount given.
### if you dont understand then the comments in the code has a better example.

## Thoughts:
It wasn't a bad program. However, trying to figure out how to simultaneously use and uptdate the values of the amounts given and received were difficult.
