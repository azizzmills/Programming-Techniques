# This folder contains the solution for the Greedy Gift Givers Problem
## Approach:
You are basically trying to figure out whether if an indivdual will have a profit or loss (net income) after they have recieved and given money for gifts.
The names of the individuals would be read into a vector "v". Then, the first indivdual in the group would receive an amount to spend and the amount of friends 
he has. Separate equally the amounts between each friend.
