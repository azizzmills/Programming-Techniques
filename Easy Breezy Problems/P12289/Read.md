# the folder contains the solution for the One Two Three problem

The approch was to read in the values. The figure out the unquie lteers in each word so that they could be distigushed no matter how each string was spelt. 
This was done by using:
w for two
a lenght more than 3 for three
then iterating through the string two, to verify spelling.
