## Approach:
The point of this program was to find the short patheto the enemy base. First thing that was needed to be done was to building the graph. Afetr the buildings and its neigbours are intialized, each building is visited going deeper and deeper into the "tree". Until the required building is found. A queue is used to keep track of the order of the buildings that are visited. The distance is tracked from the intial building to the building of interest. It program end when all possibnle paths are explored.
## Thoughs:
It's a good program. It teaches students to utilze maps.
